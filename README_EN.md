## Welcome to the **Unofficial** Interactive Common Repository for Beijing National Day School International Dept.
### READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU USE THIS PROJECT.

BNDS Commons is based on the original thread I posted on Zhihu.
The original link is https://www.zhihu.com/question/55413003/answer/935681928.
This repository(*bndsuicr*) is a backup for answers and comitts from other people in case any unforeseen event takes place.


## Usage

#### 1. Add your Issues and/or Insights.

You can freely submit your own insights via the **Issues** tab, as for you they **are** regarded **actual issues** of the school. Issues are accepted in Chinese and English.

##### Use Labels.

I have set a couple of labels for you categorise the Issues you post. As a contributer, you can tag your issues(commits) so that other viewers can find out where the problem is easily.

##### Try to be civil.

I understand your possible anger or frustration. We have all been there. I'm not asking you to be 100% clean but at least try not to curse that much when adding an issue. If you can't control your anger, I will have to delete your issue.

##### Privacy Matters for all.

Please do realise that speaking here, though **safer**, is not anonymous. If your username or email address correlate with any part of you in reality, you may **AS WELL GET INTO TROUBLE**. You can, however, disguise yourself with your github username and hide your email address in your account settings.

Meanwhile, **never** disclose others personal information, including full name, email/phone number, student/staff ID, etc. Be responsible for the community. Issues found with personal information would be deleted at sight.

#### 2. Read backup threads.

I have backed up my original thread from Zhihu. If it were to be deleted someday in the future, come to github.
